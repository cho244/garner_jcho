    "I see you've clicked onto this page. So you will see a glimpse of my coding style. It's far from done. There's a variables for me to understand exactly what the assignment was asking for the function object/ function to do. I would need to know what the user wanted to input. The condition statements can get messy. Should I assume there's only one condition (that's pretty easy, but I wanted it to be more complex)? I've been thinking about the problem and toying around with it. How do I build a function that doesn't have a long runtime (since the databases are going to be massively long) and where the user can type in a variety of specific information and get the table they were looking for? I'm being going back-and-forth changing/deleting things. I also want to make sure I can write it in a way that anyone can come in and see what each line means and why I wrote it. That is not going to be accomplishable for me within a couple of hours, especially because it's lots of information to swallow to get percision.\n",

    "The data science part of finding the answer isn't too bad, but building a pipeline is going to take me longer. I was more focused on getting the pipeline built than the straight forward answer. "
